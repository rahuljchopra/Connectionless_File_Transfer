# Connectionless_File_Transfer

The primary objective for this project is to gain experience with UNIX sockets by creating client and server programs that collaborate to achieve file transfer in a connectionless manner. The project involves building a server that establishes a socket, actively listening for incoming data transfers on a specific port. Additionally, a client program is developed to read a file from its local file system. The client then transmits this file to the server, which in turn receives the data and writes it to a file.
